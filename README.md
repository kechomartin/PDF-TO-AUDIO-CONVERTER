# PDF to Audio Converter

This project is a PDF to audio converter that converts text from PDF documents into spoken audio files. It can be used for various purposes such as converting ebooks into audiobooks, assisting visually impaired users in accessing textual content, or generating audio versions of documents for easy listening.

## Features

- Converts PDF documents to audio files.
- Supports multiple languages for text-to-speech conversion.
- Configurable voice options (e.g., gender, accent, speed).
- Batch processing for converting multiple PDFs at once.
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Usage

1. Run the converter script:

Replace `input.pdf` with the path to your PDF file, `output.mp3` with the desired output audio file name, and adjust language, voice, and speed options as needed.

2. For batch processing, create a text file (`input_files.txt`) containing paths to multiple PDF files, with each path on a new line. Then run:

This will convert all PDFs listed in `input_files.txt` to audio files in the `audio_files` directory.
